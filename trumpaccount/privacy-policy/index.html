<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="date">Last updated: February 6, 2026</p>

<p>TrumpAccount ("we", "our", or "the app") is a mobile application developed by Terror LLC that helps you track and manage 530A children's savings account contributions. Your financial and personal data is sensitive, and we take its privacy and security very seriously. This policy describes how we collect, use, and protect your information.</p>

<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> TrumpAccount is an independent third-party tracking tool and is NOT affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by the United States government, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the Department of the Treasury, or any government agency. The app does not provide financial, tax, or investment advice.</p>

<h2>Information We Collect</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> When you sign in with Apple, we receive your Apple ID email address (or a private relay address) and a unique user identifier. We use this solely to create and manage your account.</li>
  <li><strong>Children's Information:</strong> Names and dates of birth of children you add to the app for the purpose of tracking their 530A savings accounts. This information is provided voluntarily by you and is used only for account tracking within the app.</li>
  <li><strong>Financial Contribution Data:</strong> Contribution amounts, dates, and related details you record in the app to track savings activity.</li>
  <li><strong>Partial SSN (Optional):</strong> If you choose to store the last 4 digits of a child's Social Security Number for your own reference, this data is stored securely. This field is entirely optional and is never required.</li>
  <li><strong>Subscription Information:</strong> If you subscribe to TrumpAccount Premium, purchase and subscription status is managed through Apple's StoreKit in-app purchase system.</li>
</ul>

<h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>

  <li>To authenticate your account and provide app functionality</li>
