<p>BP Companion ("we", "our", or "the app") is a mobile application developed by Terror LLC that helps you track and monitor your blood pressure and heart rate readings. Your health data is sensitive, and we take its privacy and security very seriously. This policy describes how we collect, use, and protect your information.</p>

<h2>Information We Collect</h2>
<ul>

  <li><strong>Heart Rate Data:</strong> Heart rate measurements you record or sync from Apple Health.</li>
  <li><strong>Medication Information:</strong> Any medication details you choose to log within the app, such as medication names, dosages, and schedules.</li>
  <li><strong>Apple HealthKit Data:</strong> With your explicit permission, we read blood pressure and heart rate data from Apple HealthKit and may write your recorded measurements back to HealthKit. We only access the specific health data categories you authorize.</li>
  <li><strong>Subscription Information:</strong> If you subscribe to BP Companion Premium, purchase and subscription status is managed through Apple's StoreKit in-app purchase system.</li>
